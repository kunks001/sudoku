Sudoku Details
--------------

  *  This week we'll build an engine to play the Sudoku game
  *  The engine should be able to solve an easy sudoku, eliminating a cell's possible values by looking at its neighbouring cells.
  *  The engine should also be able to solve a hard sudoku, using recursion to "guess" the value of cells for which there are multiple possible values
